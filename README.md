# readerly2
New and improved readerly app

This is the first group project at Coding Dojo Coding School. It was completed over the course of 4 days.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by our passion for books and maps and to integrate a "Goodreads" feature and a "Google Maps" feature. As we make our way through web development courses, we are learning by doing.

## What it does
Our web application has 4 main pages. We have a login & registration page that validates if there are any errors input into the text fields. The main dashboard page is where people can search for books and read book summaries and add them to their favorites (by way of Google Books API). The EVENTS page displays a map with pinned book-related events (using Google Maps API and Google Geocoding API by way of scarped Barnes and Noble events). Lastly, there is an update profile page.

## How we built it
Our team used Django to build the database and website structure. APIs used were Google Books, Google Maps, and Google Geocode. 

## Challenges we ran into
Git errors - initally we ran into many git conflicts that forced us to start a new Git repo. Learning APIs was also a learning curve. Using the webscraper had some difficulties of making too many URL requests and grabbing unwanted characters from the text that needed to be manually cleaned afterwards.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had great communication and checked in with each other regularly to keep to our list of goals. We are very proud to have created this site as our first project to display what we have learned thus far in the curriculum and what we were able to teach ourselves in our journey to become self-sufficient developers. We were getting along very well under the tight deadline and everyone was able to contribute to the project.

## What we learned
We explored APIs, password validation, how to incorporate multiple apps in our Django project, and how to create a webscraper. We also learned how to collaborate as a team on Github and how to deploy our site to a specific domain.

## Built With
Javascript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Python, Django
